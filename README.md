Hi There,

Welcome to my profile, here's a short intro about myself:

I am currently working in Astrazeneca as a Data Analyst, where my work is mostly focused on developing sales forecasting visualizations in PowerBI. In my free time, I like dabble around in R, Python and Statistics.

If you are interested in R programming, you might like to follow [@data_question](https://twitter.com/data_question) on twitter, where I post an R question daily. You might also like the following quiz on [subsetting in R](https://monty.shinyapps.io/subsetting/#section-quiz)
